# Claude Instructions

You are working in the **depot** monorepo.

- Before doing anything, read the root `AGENTS.md` for project-wide guidance.
- For any file you touch, also read the nearest `AGENTS.md` in that directory tree and follow its instructions.
- Defer to `AGENTS.md` over assumptions; it defines layout, commands, and coding conventions.
