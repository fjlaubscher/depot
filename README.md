# depot

A Warhammer 40,000 companion app powered by [Wahapedia](https://wahapedia.ru) data. Build army lists, browse datasheets, and plan your crusades with offline-capable tools.

*"Knowledge is power, guard it well."*

Built as a modern monorepo with three packages:
- **@depot/cli** - Processes Wahapedia CSV exports into structured JSON
- **@depot/core** - Shared TypeScript types and utilities
- **@depot/web** - React PWA with offline roster building

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: >=22.0.0
- **Package Manager**: pnpm >=8.0.0

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development (generates data + dev server)
pnpm start
```

This downloads Wahapedia data, processes it, and starts the web development server.

## Commands

```bash
# Generate fresh data only
pnpm --filter @depot/cli start

# Force re-download source data
pnpm refresh-data

# Production build
pnpm build

# Code quality (run before commits)
pnpm format
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

## Features
